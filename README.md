lazy attempt to see how feasable chat ai assited code generation could be made into a actaully good tool

the quality is kinda low rn(for d lang) presumablly the code gpt 3 ais werent trained on it, but the chat gpt 3.5 is better at one shots or looking up apis?

idk i'll wait for a better interface
